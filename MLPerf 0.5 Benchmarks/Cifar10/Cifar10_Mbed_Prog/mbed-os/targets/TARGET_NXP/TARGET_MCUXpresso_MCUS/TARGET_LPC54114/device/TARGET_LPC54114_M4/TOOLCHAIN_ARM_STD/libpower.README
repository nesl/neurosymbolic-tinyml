LPC54114 libpower.ar README

The libpower.ar library provides the following functions for optimized power management on LPC54114 devices. Features include:
1. Simple APIs to control power consumption and wake-up in all power modes.
2. Manage power consumption for sleep and active modes
3. Prepare the part to enter low power modes (sleep, deep-sleep, and deep power-down).
4. Configure wake-up from deep-sleep via functions enabled by bits in the PDRUNCFG registers.

The APIs provided by the library are fully described in the LPC54114 User Manual (document UM10914) which is available from https://www.nxp.com
